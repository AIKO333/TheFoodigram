            <p class="fade-in">I asked my sister to wash potatoes and when I turned around she was scrubbing them with detergent and the dish sponge.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="fade-in">A friend bought 5 lbs of meat sausage. I used half in a sauce for pasta and told my husband to take the leftovers to work for lunch. He took the half of raw sausage, and ate it all and didn't notice until I called and asked why he didn't take his lunch(The Pasta).</p>
            <br>
            <p class="fade-in">One day I was cooking for my husband and asked him to watch the onions while I checked on my elderly grandad next door. When I came back, I found a blackened pan containing what used to be fried onions. He 'watched' them burn and didn't understood what he should have done.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="fade-in">One day I was sitting on my couch and heard a slapping sound. I turned around and my friend is slapping the chicken I asked what he is doing and he said the recipe said to pat chicken dry. I told him he is supposed to use a towel. He went and got a bath towel!</p>
            <br>
            <p class="fade-in">My dad made dinner, with a recipe, and it would have been good, except where it says to add salt, it didn't say how much, so he added a quarter cup.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="fade-in">I've always ordered my soft drinks in a simple way, e.g. 'A Coke, please'. Lately, though, this hasn't seemed to work. Waitresses now often respond, 'I'm sorry, we don't have Coke. We have Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Dr. Pepper, 7-Up, Hartridges, Virgin Cola, Sprite and Red Bull'. Exhausted by listening to the long list of soft drinks, I thought I'd make life easier. So one day I simply asked the snack bar staff at a cinema for a 'dark, cold, carbonated beverage'. The young man behind the counter smiled and asked, 'Yes sir, and would you like a long, thin, cylindrical plastic sucking device with that?'</p>
            <br>
            <p class="fade-in">One time, I went to a party where they were serving spaghetti and meatballs. I accidentally dropped a meatball on the floor and, not wanting to waste it, I picked it up and ate it. It turns out that it was a dog toy that had fallen off the table!</p>
            <br>
            <p class="fade-in">During a family vacation to Japan, we went to a restaurant where they served a dish with live shrimp. My dad, who is always up for a challenge, tried to eat the shrimp whole and ended up with a mouthful of wriggling shrimp.</p>
